# How to make a clean pull request


------------------------ For people who want to contribute or pull request ------------------------

# Create a personal fork of the project on Github. Forks: Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point
# for your own idea. You can fork a repository to create a copy of the repository and make changes without affecting the upstream repository.
# how to fork: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo

# Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called origin.
git clone https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git
git remote add origin https://github.com/personal_fork/Spoon-Knife.git

# Add the original repository as a remote called upstream.
git remote add upstreans https://github.com/original_owner/Spoon-Knife.git

# check both remotes
git remote -v

# If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
git pull upstreams master -> all data of upstreams/master will come to master branch

# Optional : Create a new branch to work on! Branch from develop if it exists, else from master.
# Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
# Add or change the documentation as needed.
# optional : Squash your commits into a single commit with git's interactive rebase. Create a new branch if necessary.

# Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote origin.
git push -u orgin master -> push all data from master to origin remote

# From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's develop branch if there is one, else go for master!
# Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).
